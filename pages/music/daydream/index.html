                <p>
                    Hey! It's been a while...
                    Sorry it's taken so goddamn long to finish this project, I really hope you like it!
                    <br><br>
                    I wanted to write about the album prior to releasing it to decompress and look back at
                    all of the work and scrapped ideas that have gone into its creation. I'd like to say it
                    came easy, that I was in <a href="https://archive.ph/BjBl8" target="_blank">"development heaven"</a>
                    and
                    I was bursting with creativity for
                    the better part of 3 years, but it was definitely not.
                    <br><br>
                    If you just want a bit about each song on the released version and some BTS, skip to
                    <strong><a href="#dda">Daydream Automata</a></strong> otherwise, I'll go over some scrapped
                    ideas now :&rpar;
                <h1 id="orbit"><a href="#orbit">&gt;Orbit</a></h1>
                <p>
                    Originally, before Daydream, when all the dust had settled from my previous releases (Faded Horizons & An End of
                    Sorts)
                    and I was left with this pile of strewn together songs, I attached to it an idea i'd had for a while
                    -
                    a "dual sided" album that is part Daytime and Nighttime, "Orbit".
                    <br><br>
                    Most a good portion of songs from Orbit made it to DDA, and so this was more transitionary than
                    anything
                    else. I also got from this the "so retro" vibe that would eventually comprise DDAs whole visual
                    aesthetic,
                    trying to emulate the PS2's low-poly, billboarded graphics and boxy skyboxes. I eventually got what
                    I
                    wanted
                    from tinkering in blender:

                    <img src="orbit/OrbitSplit.png" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    I even made a few music videos with the older iterations of the songs, like this one, for "Castillo
                    Del
                    Sol"
                    (which would become BOOTLOADER):

                <p>
                    Here are a couple of the scrapped songs that didn't make it to release, which is not to say they
                    won't
                    be released
                    in an official capacity some time later!

                    Daydream Automata is a love letter to all days of my childhood, where I would spend messing with
                    every font
                    in Windows 98 Wordpad, and playing with a copy of Netscpe Navigator that wasn't even connected to
                    the internet most of the time.
                    <br><br>
                    It's also just a compilation of the many moments from my life that have happened during its
                    creation,
                    big or small, scary or joyful, listening back on this album feels like a time capsule of my young
                    adult life.

                                express {to eternal bliss}</a> by bliss3three, this song originally was a burst of
                            creative energy
                            in one day that ended up being about 1:30 and pretty well off to stand alone. It's the first
                            song I ever made that utilizes the chopped up Amen Break beat, and layered with the bright
                            synths and stuttering
                            chords, it fits well. Eventaually I added a B section after finding some new synth patches
                            that are reminicent of
                            the aforementioned songs' trumpets, and a mix of the A and B sections into a big finish,
                            similar to wwhat I did on FOTE6.</p>

                            I would come back to it to flesh it out into a longer song with
                            some actual progression to it. I'm quite fond of the transition section and the
                            blaster-sounding riser

                                target="_blank">ShaperBox 3</a> was something I got myself in november 2023 impulsively
                            as it went on sale for black friday. It has a unique "time shaper" LFO that allows you to
                            bend, reverse, slow down and speed up time across multiple
                            bars by frequency. This song's main arpegggiating structure was my first ever real test of
                            that and I kept it throughout the making of this album.
                            <br><br>
                            The songs title is a kind of personal response to <em>An End of Sorts</em>, which was the
                            byproduct of a months-long obsession with someone following a series of int/er/ra/personal
                            events.
                            It was a way of expressing the complex and convoluted fight of knowing what I was doing was
                            unhealthy and unproductive but not being able to stop myself...
                            In a way, this is the real finale to that single, I eventually did have some kind of
                            resolution, and had finally broken free of, or rather redirected that
                            manic mindset somewere else.

                            I created a majority of the melodies and pads I used here in one session running off of
                            battery in my University's public library. The waltz-y feeling
                            bells remind me of the Fungal Wastes area of Hollow Knight. I tried to make this feel grand
                            with a big operatic choir, echoy plucked strings and a large
                            sea of synths, but my favorite moment of the whole song is the end - that just reiterates
                            the original melody through the soft exhaling breath of the section
                            prior.

                            The section of the music video for this song is all footage from NASA's Exploration of the
                            Planets Documentary. I tried to cut it together to make a cohesive
                            visual story about Voyager making a fly-by, but unfortunately there was not enough footage
                            to keep the same planet as the centerpiece (I would have loved it
                            to be Saturn the whole way through)

                            When I originally made this song, I was in the middle of a 4 month period where I had to be
                            off of some menally stabilizing medications for health reasons. The initial
                            version was a lot less "energetic" and more of an ambient piece containing the pads from the
                            final, and very muted breakbeat. Coming back to it after I had gotten back
                            on my medication, I took it in a more "happy" direction with a low-passed bit lead and
                            faster drums.
                            There is a little earcandy sound effect coming from UNDERTALE in the song, being the 3 notes
                            played
                            when you save, followed by the sound of an attack. If you know anything about the game, I
                            think the
                            same mindset you have you'd hear that sound in game, is similar to what I had when this
                            first came to be.

                            I took the drums from this "scrapped(?)" song I made and slowed them down.

                            I don't have much to say other than that the I really love the dueting vox synths playing in
                            each ear. I'm not sure where I found the
                            patch, but they have a great quality to them.

                        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">This was my first and only attempt at doing some kind of microtonal
                            song, and I think it
                            turned out quite well! This one is 31 EDO (Equal Divisions of the Octave as opposed to the
                            standard 12), and I think
                            it enhances the emotional aspect I was going for on this one. To me, this song is like the
                            kind of scream-singing in the shower
                            you do when you're sure no one else is home, and letting out everything at once, which is
                            whY I chose a supernova for the
                            part of this song in the music video. I think an ambient end to this album, similar to
                            something you might have heard on FOTE6
                            is a great way to finish off so much effort and emotion. Thank you for listening to my
                            music. Thank you for reading my thoughts.<br><br>
